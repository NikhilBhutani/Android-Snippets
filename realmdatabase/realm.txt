What is Realm ?
Realm is a third party database tool that claims to be a replacement for SQLite and coreData and attempts to simplify a issues encountered
while writing SQLite such as boilerplate code, threading support and asynchronous queries. Currently, you can use Realm in your android app
built using java, IOS using swift or objective C or a cross platform app built using React Native.

Realm with java
Models
A model represents the data that you want to store, which in our case is the goal that a person wishes to achieve(What), the time it was added
the target time, the target time or the time by which you would like to accomplish the goal(when) and whether the goal was marked complete
by the user or not.

In realm you don't need to create a table for the same while using Realm .
1. Create a class in java
2. Extend from RealmObject which essentially qualifies  your class  as being  the model.

Zero Copy in Realm
In simple words we have an item that has been repeated in sqlite it will stored in seperate times,
where as in Realm you will have 1 main copy of the object and all the other objects will simply refer to that copy and its values
